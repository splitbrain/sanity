Syntax: sanity.pl [options] <file(s)>

This tool renames files back to sane names. It does so by replacing
spaces, german umlauts and some special chars by underscores.

If a renamed version of a file already exists the renaming will be
skipped.

Options:

    -l convert to lowercase
    -e extended cleaning (removes brackets as well)
    -a convert all files - don't exclude hidden files and dirs

The argument can be files and directories. WARNING: Directories will
be recurseively changed.
